# SSH Log Exporter: Observe Attack Attempts with Prometheus

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/DenBeke/ssh-log-exporter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/DenBeke/ssh-log-exporter)

**WIP**: Prometheus exporter that listens on `/var/log/auth.log` events and exposes counters with the the failed login attempts. Labels (for now): `ip` and `country`.

‚ö†Ô∏è This was written on a Friday night, while drinking some Belgian beers. You better don't look too much at the code, and don't use it in production. üòáüçª
